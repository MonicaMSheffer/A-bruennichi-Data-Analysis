# Abruennichi_DataAnalysis_forSubmission
This repository contains the scripts and output of analyses done in R pertaining to the publication, "Rapid ecological and evolutionary divergence during a poleward range expansion" by Sheffer et al. Due to the size of the data, not all data is included in this repository, but see [link] for that data. That data is only required for the 00_climate_data_wrangling.R script; in order to run this script, download the bioclim folder from [link] and put it in the data folder of the R project. For the main purposes of the analyses, you would not need to run the climate data wrangling script; the output is available and usable for all downstream analyses (used mainly in script 01_import_data.R and 01_maternalphenotype_latitude.R)

Scripts should be run in numerical order as named, with the exception of the script "myplot.R" which is a function for plotting that is called in the 00_climate_data_wrangling.R script.
